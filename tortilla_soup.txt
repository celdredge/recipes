Ingredients
1 9-ounce package soft corn tortillas
2 32-ounce boxes or cans low-sodium chicken broth
Bones and meat from half a grilled or roasted 4-pound chicken
1 large red onion, coarsely chopped
2 large tomatoes, diced
2 medium jalapenos, sliced
Juice of 1 lime
2 ears grilled corn
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1 ripe avocado, peeled and cubed
8 ounces crumbled Feta cheese, queso blanco, or other fresh white cheese
Preparation
Heat oven to 350ยบ F. Cut the tortillas into 1/2-inch strips. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake 8 to 10 minutes or until crispy.

In a large saucepan, simmer the chicken broth, bones, and meat for 20 minutes. Strain the broth through a colander into another saucepan. When the bones are cool enough to handle, pick off any meat and add it to the broth. Stir in the red onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and lime juice. Heat about 5 minutes. Cut the corn from the cobs and add it to the soup. Divide the tortilla strips among 4 bowls. Ladle in the soup and top with cilantro, avocado, and cheese.
